# Matrix transpose demo
This program prompts the user to enter a number between 1 and 20. It then asks for the number of rows and columns to create a matrix. After that, it generates random numbers between 0 and 20 to populate the original matrix. The program then prints the original matrix.
Next, it calculates the transpose of the original matrix and stores it in the transpose array. The transpose of a matrix is obtained by interchanging its rows with columns. Finally, it prints the transpose matrix.
In summary, this program generates a random matrix based on user input and displays both the original matrix and its transpose.
